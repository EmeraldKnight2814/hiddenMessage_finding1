# hiddenMessage_finding1
For those of you that don't know, it is possible to hide text within image files without using a program like Photoshop or something to literally hide it. The text will remain hidden until viewed upon in a program such as WinHex

I noticed when doing this though that all the messages I had seen were done in English. I decided that I wanted to see what would happen if I put a message in another language, preferably one that does not use the roman alphabet that English, French, Spanish and so on use.

Attached in this repo is an image that contains one such message. Ganbatte, nakama.



sha256 value for the image is: "7c154568048f8627fe6844de1c0eb2d737fe51210ee55e9ee4d6f43dfbb8a7eb".
